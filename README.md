# ShareX
Application and Verification simplified


The problem ShareX solves
ShareX is a decentralized document sharing platform that simplifies the process of secure document sharing and verification using IPFS and blockchain technologies. It provides features for managing and verifying documents, with uploaded documents stored in IPFS and their hash stored on the blockchain. Our web-based application is easy to use for users, verifiers, and admins, making document sharing and verification a breeze.Centralized servers are vulnerable to cyber threats and data breaches.ShareX not only addresses this concern by providing a decentralized storage but also allows sharing and attestation of critical documents like aadhar, pan etc.. .Also we are providing a framework to convert current web2 to web3 to utilize decentralize storage,which avoid threats of single point failure in centralized databases.User obtains sense of data owership with blockchain.This project also creates a streamline flow of document attestation.By using our framework we create a simple user experience to share documents securely.ShareX not only provides decentralized storage but also builds trust among its users.
